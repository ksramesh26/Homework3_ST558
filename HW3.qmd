## Task 1 

### Question 1 

```{r}
read_csv("Data/data.txt")


```

The reason that we cannot use read_csv is that the data is delimited by something other than a comma or a tab. 


```{r}
data = read_csv2("Data/data.txt")
data
```


### Question 2


```{r}
data2 = read_delim("Data/data2.txt",
  delim = "6",
  col_types = cols(
    x = col_factor(),
    y = col_double(),
    z = col_character()
  )
  
)


data2
```
